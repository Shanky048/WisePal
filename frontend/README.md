# WisePal

**WisePal** is a conversational AI web application that allows users to interact with an intelligent assistant through a modern, responsive chat interface. This project demonstrates practical skills in backend API development, frontend engineering, and AI model integration.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Conversational AI platform built with Python (FastAPI), React (Next.js), and Tailwind CSS.
- Integrates open-source natural language models from Hugging Face Transformers for real-time chatbot responses.
- Features a clean, user-friendly chat UI with dynamic conversation history.
- Designed, implemented, and documented entirely by me as a demonstration of end-to-end product engineering.
